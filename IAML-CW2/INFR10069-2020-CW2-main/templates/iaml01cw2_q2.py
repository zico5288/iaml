#  Python script template for Question 2 (IAML Level 10)
#  Note that
#  - You should not change the name of this file, 'iaml01cw2_q2.py', which is the file name you should use when you submit your code for this question.
#  - You should write code for the functions defined below. Do not change their names.
#  - You can define function arguments (parameters) and returns (attributes) if necessary.
#  - In case you define additional functions, do not define them here, but put them in a separate Python module file, "iaml01cw2_my_helpers.py", and import it in this script.
#  - For those questions requiring you to show results in tables, your code does not need to present them in tables - just showing them with print() is fine.
#  - You do not need to include this header in your submission.
